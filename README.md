* __`clamav.timeout`:__ ClamAV daemon socket timeout.
* __`clamav.retries`:__ ClamAV daemon socket connect retries. `0` by default.
* __`web.listen-address`:__ Address to listen on for web interface and telemetry.
* __`web.telemetry-path`:__ Path under which to expose metrics.
* __`log.level`:__ Logging level. `info` by default.

### TLS and basic authentication

The clamav_exporter supports TLS and basic authentication.
To use TLS and/or basic authentication, you need to pass a configuration file
using the `--web.config.file` parameter. The format of the file is described
[in the exporter-toolkit repository](https://github.com/prometheus/exporter-toolkit/blob/master/docs/web-configuration.md).
